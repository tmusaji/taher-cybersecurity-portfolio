PortSwigger Web Security Academy (230+ Labs)

Successfully solved 230+ hands-on labs aligned with the OWASP Top 10.
Exploited vulnerabilities including SQL Injection, XSS (stored, reflected, DOM-based), CSRF, SSRF, IDOR, insecure deserialization, file upload flaws, and access-control bypasses.
Used Burp Suite to intercept and manipulate HTTP requests, bypass validation logic, exploit broken authentication, and escalate privileges.
Performed impact analysis involving unauthorized data access, account takeover, privilege escalation, and backend system compromise.
Developed a structured penetration testing approach covering reconnaissance, exploitation, validation, and remediation understanding.

Key Projects

HackerNote – Intentionally Vulnerable Web Application (Flagship Project)
Tech Stack: Python (Flask), SQLite, JWT, OAuth 2.0, GraphQL, HTML, JavaScript

Designed and developed an intentionally vulnerable web application to simulate real-world penetration testing and bug bounty scenarios.
Implemented and exploited critical OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities including broken authentication and authorization, SQL Injection with WAF bypass, JWT authentication bypass (alg:none), SSRF, insecure deserialization, DOM-based XSS, business logic flaws, OAuth token confusion, GraphQL introspection abuse, prototype pollution, and race conditions.
Used the application as a self-practice lab to replicate attacker workflows and understand exploitation chains.
Strengthened skills in manual testing, payload crafting, exploitation validation, and impact analysis.

Multithreaded Port Scanner & Threat Intelligence Tool
Tech Stack: Python, TCP/IP, Socket Programming, ThreadPoolExecutor, VirusTotal API, REST APIs

Built a multithreaded TCP port scanner to identify open ports and running services.
Integrated VirusTotal API v3 for URL and IP reputation analysis.
Generated automated HTML security reports summarizing network exposure and threat intelligence findings.
Improved understanding of network reconnaissance, enumeration, and exposure analysis.

GDPR Compliance Checker
Tech Stack: Python, PyTorch, Sentence-BERT (MiniLM), BiLSTM, NLTK, HTML/CSS

Developed an automated tool to analyze organizational policies for GDPR compliance.
Implemented Sentence-BERT embeddings with a BiLSTM classifier to perform multi-label classification across core GDPR principles.
Generated structured compliance reports highlighting regulatory gaps to assist security and compliance audits.

Professional Summary

I am an aspiring cybersecurity professional with a strong focus on web application security, vulnerability assessment, and offensive security. I have built deep hands-on experience through structured lab practice, real-world security projects, and continuous self-learning. My approach emphasizes understanding root causes, business impact, and exploitation methodology rather than relying solely on automated tools.
